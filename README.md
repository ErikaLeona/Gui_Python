## Description
Creating an interference plot in Python to visualize the current-voltage and power-voltage characteristics of a PV panel. You can choose one of 4 options: 3 existing panels of the same power, or you can create one using the Custom option in the comboBox. It is also possible to change both the solar irradiance received by the panel and the cell temperature.
